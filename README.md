## About me and my carrer

My name is Tobias (aka Tobi) and after a few years of working in different e-commerce companies in the departement of product data manegment, it was time for a change in my life and carrer.
I always liked the whole communication part during the phase of a project, no matter how big or small the project was and the role as a user and client.

But I was always missing the knowledge of software developement and that was something, that botherd me.

Due to that, my interests and my experiences, working with software developers and to have some friends working in this area, I found "neue Fische" and the [web developer bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development) bootcamp.

After the first steps as a product owner till the end of 2024, I'm more than ready for the new part of my life.
I started my new adventure in july 2023 and finished it in october 2023

After the first steps as a product owner till the end of 2024, I'm more than ready for the new part of my life.

I'm realy hyped for this new adventure and to become a experienced web developer ✨
